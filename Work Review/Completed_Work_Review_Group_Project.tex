% The first argument is the \documentclass, which tells latex which template
% we're using to build this document. It's usually safe to just use "article".
\documentclass{article}

% include some packages...
\usepackage{fullpage} % change settings for a smaller margin
\usepackage{graphicx} % gives access to the \includegraphics command
\usepackage{hyperref} % gives the ability to href links
\hypersetup{
	colorlinks=true,
	linkcolor=blue,
	filecolor=magenta,

% tell Latex to use no paragraph indentation, but leave some space between
% paragraphs 
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

	This document will be used to report the work completed, the hours spent, and by whom in the group completed the work. This will also state the amount of git commits for the project, and individual, within our final repository.
	
	
	
	\section{Overview of the Final Git Repository}
	
	The final repository that was used for application can be found \href{https://github.com/willissa2121/library_checkout_proj_3}{here}. However, it should be noted that we relocated to this location due to become highly disorganized in our previous used repositories which can be found \href{https://github.com/willissa2121/library_checkout_proj_2}{here} and \href{https://github.com/willissa2121/library_checkout_proj}{here}. If you are reading this as a printed out document, there will be a resources section that will have a list of these and any other urls used in this document.\\
	
	In Table 1, you can see the overall information regarding the history of our git repository. Please note, when it comes to the amount of git commits, we will only be referring to the commits done within the final repository. This is due to the fact hat most of our work was done within this repository itself. This information is accurate as of 4/16/2022. \\
