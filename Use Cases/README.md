# Use Case Video Demonstration

This subsection contains the most up to date Use Cases and the video demonstration for them. Currenlty the Use Cases themselves have their own directory which holds the pdf for each individual use case.<br>

The other directory contains the zipped video files demonstrating the 6 Use cases broken into two parts. Part 1 shows the stoping of our application, show the application is unreachable, restarting said application, and then reaching the application. From there on the Use cases for Registering, Logining in, and checking out a book are demonstrated. Each Use Case is proceded by a Title Slide to indicate which Use Case is currently being shown. <br>

Part 2 of the video files is the continuation. This video covers the finishes covering our use cases which include adding a book, updating a book, and deleting a book from this application. <br>


### Considerations

If you wish to watch the demonstration, I highly recommend starting with Part 1 and then part 2.
