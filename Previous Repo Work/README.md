# Previous Submitted Work

This is the previous work that we have completed regarding this project. Unfortuantealy, we let our previous repos fall into disarray and felt that it would be best to reorganize and start fresh on a repo. Due to this, we did not wish to lose that history of work, we brought it here to live within the new repo.

#### The Previous Repos Location

This is the address for [Repo 1](https://github.com/willissa2121/library_checkout_proj) 
and this the addres for [Repo 2](https://github.com/willissa2121/library_checkout_proj_2).

#### Setup of this directory

This directory is the information that was submitted for previous assignements. Each directory, i.e. Api, Gannt Diagram, Use Cases, etc., is further broken down into interation 1 or 2 based on if something that falls within that category for the required documentation. For example, there is something within both iteration 1 and 2 for Gannt Diagrams, but there is only something found in iteration 2 for the API Model.
